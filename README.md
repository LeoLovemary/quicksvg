# quicksvg

This is a tiny library for generating SVG files from within C++. It plots time series, and graphs functions, and that's it. If you use it, you should think "huh, that kinda did what I wanted", and accept that the result is good enough, or you should give up immediately.

Here's an example of a function graphed:
